            <br><p id="para"> Zachery D'Andrea is proud to be the owner of Sugar Land Munchies. Sugar Land Munchies was founded by Zach in order
                to provide students who attend class at the Sugar Land campus a way to access their meal plan rather than
                spending their own money to buy food in addition to their meal plan. This was a personal issue for Zach 
                as he had purchased the meal plan, yet needed to spend extra money to buy food when at his Sugar land classes. 
                Zach hopes that buy opening Sugar Land Munchies, he is making the lives of all University of Houston Sugar Land students 
                easier and more affordable.
                <br><br>
                Zach is a student at the University of Houston, currently attaining his Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information 
                Systems. While he lives on the main campus and is taking courses like Texas Constiution and Philosophy of the Arts at 
                the main campus, many of his classes are at Sugar Land. For the Spring 2024 semester, he is taking Web Development, User 
                Experience Principles, and Information System Application Development.
                <br><br>
                In addition to being a full time college student and the owner of Sugar Land Munchies, Zach is also a Second Lieutenant 
                in the Texas Army National Guard. Prior to attending the University of Houston, Zach attended Valley Forge Military 
                College in Wayne, PA. While at Valley Forge, Zach earned an Associate of Science in Business Administration and 
                he earned his commission as an officer in the United States Army through the ROTC program.
                <br><br>
                In his free time, Zach enjoys working out and playing video games. He has run competitively for the past few years. He ran 
                cross country in high school and at Valley Forge. He also ran in the 2022 Philadelphia Marathon with a time of 4 hours 
                and 22 minutes. Zach has recently shifted towards training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu over the past two years and plans on 
                competing later this year.
                <br><br>
                Zach is also not originally from Texas, his father was in the Navy and was stationed in Hawaii. He had spent most
                of his life growing up in Hawaii on the island of Oahu. It wasn't until he received his Army ROTC scholarship and 
                had been accepted into Valley Forge that he moved away from Hawaii.
